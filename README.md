# KUET Chatbot

This is a chatbot built using Flask and Python that provides information about the Khulna University of Engineering and Technology (KUET), Bangladesh.

## Prerequisites

You will need Python 3.x and Flask to run the chatbot. You can install Flask by running:

```
pip install Flask
```

## Installation

To install the chatbot, you can download the code from the GitHub repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
```

## Usage

Once you have downloaded the code, you can run the chatbot by executing the following command from the root directory:

```
python app.py
```

This will start the Flask server, and you can access the chatbot by opening your web browser and going to http://localhost:5000.

The chatbot has two main functionalities: text summarization and error correction. To access these functionalities, you can click on the "Summarization" or "Error Correction" links in the navigation bar.

The text summarization feature allows you to input a text and get a summary of that text. The summary is generated using a pre-trained model from the Hugging Face Transformers library.

The error correction feature allows you to input a text with errors, and get the corrected text as output. This feature uses a pre-trained model from the Hugging Face Transformers library to perform error correction.

The chatbot also has a conversation mode, where you can ask questions about KUET and get answers from the chatbot. To start the conversation mode, click on the "Chatbot" link in the navigation bar.
